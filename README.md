# Developement

-The main component rendering the Search page is the header component and contains the pseudo for what needs to happen next to get a book from the search saved to the database.

-The main component that will be used for the Saved Page is Save.js component and contains the pseudo code along with framework of the code to make a api call to the database to render books from the data base to the scren. Also how I plan on creating click event handlers for the buttons to delete the book from the database and viewing the book on google books.

-In the api folder I have pseudo coded and added framework for routes to get and send data from the DB to store and remove books.
